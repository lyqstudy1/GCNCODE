Use STK to create a three-layer Walker satellite constellation, including 100 LEO satellites at an altitude of 550 km, 25 MEO satellites at an altitude of 2500 km, and 3 MEO satellites at an altitude of 8000 km, as shown in the figure below. Then export 4000 csv files from STK, which are the satellite visibility distance matrices of 4000 time slots.
