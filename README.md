# GCNCODE
Create a three-layer Walker satellite constellation using STK, including 100 LEO satellites at an altitude of 550km, 25 MEO satellites at an altitude of 2500km, and 3 MEO satellites at an altitude of 8000km. Then export the satellite distance matrix for 4000 time slots from STK, as shown in the following figure.
