Use STK to create a three-layer Walker satellite constellation, including 100 LEO satellites at an altitude of 550 kilometers, 25 MEO satellites at an altitude of 2500 kilometers, and 3 MEO satellites at an altitude of 8000 kilometers, as shown in the figure below. Export 4000 csv files from STK, that is, the satellite visibility distance matrix of 4000 time slots. Based on these visibility matrices, calculate the delay matrix and visibility matrix from the controller to the switch.
